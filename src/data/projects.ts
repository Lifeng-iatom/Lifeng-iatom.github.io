    title: "Tour! Tour! Tour!",
    description: "One golden morning, a curious kitten named Dinger tumbles into a mysterious crack beneath the vineyard—and finds himself in a forgotten underground world. There, he meets Vitis, a glowing little grape seed with ancient roots and big dreams. Together, they travel through mossy tunnels, lush forests, torrential rains, and shifting landscapes, discovering strange creatures and the quiet rhythms of growth. As Vitis sprouts, blossoms, and bears fruit, Dinger learns about change, memory, and the deep time hidden beneath our feet.",

    title: "They licked the plates. Is that a yes?",
    description: "In the quiet forest night, a mysterious little restaurant opened in secret. No one knew who the chef was—only that a new dish appeared on the menu every night. Curious, the animals held a meeting and sent a butterfly, a mouse, and a bear to investigate. They tasted “Hope Dew,” “Sylvan Spine,” and “Starberry Reverie”—strange, warm, and wonderful. In the corner of the kitchen, a pair of yellow-green eyes quietly sparkled, watching with curiosity and nervousness.Could this hidden chef become their new friend?",

    description: "In a desert white as salt, a lone traveler walks forward. He does not know where he is going, but he knows that where he walks, the sea once sang. He walks, pauses, looks to the sky, listens to the sand. His footsteps fade, faces sleep beneath the earth, and the clouds whisper something ancient.",

    title: "Structure of Becoming",
    description: "This series explores the hidden architecture of the plant world—its anatomy, evolution, and ecological storytelling. From microscopic dissections to seed dispersal diagrams, each illustration blends scientific precision with visual clarity. Alongside ancient plants and prehistoric creatures, the works trace how life structures itself, survives, and transforms. Drawing from paleobotany, plant morphology, and paleoecology, the series offers a quiet homage to the beauty of botanical science.",

    title: "Horizon Held",
    description: "Horizon Held is a quiet meditation on space, solitude, and the unseen weight of stillness. In this series, wide skies meet slow-growing fields, and the land becomes a silent companion. Whether it’s a girl curled into the spiral of grass, or a pale plain stretching to the edge of dusk, each image holds a moment of deep listening. The horizon here is not an ending—but a breathing line between memory and possibility. Through gentle textures and grounded compositions, the series explores how landscapes can cradle emotion, and how rest itself can be a form of connection to place. These are not empty spaces—they are soft containers for pause, presence, and becoming.",

    title: "Whisker Petals",
    description: "Whisker Petals is a playful botanical dreamworld, where curious cats tiptoe through oversized flowers and drifting seeds. Inspired by the gentle mischief of feline explorers and the secret lives of plants, the series blends whimsy with wonder. Each piece is a small adventure—part garden, part imagination—where paws brush petals and leaves hum with hidden stories. Through soft lines and organic forms, Whisker Petals celebrates the poetry of everyday encounters between animals and the green world around us.",
